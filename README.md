# ownlisp

Small toy lisp for my own education and enjoyment.
Built with the help of http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents

Has a small toy sintax extension for visual studio code included.
The standard library barely deserves its name.

Not yet cleaned up and developed over a few days without any tests in place...
