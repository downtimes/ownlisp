# ownlisp

Small toy lisp for my own education and enjoyment.
Built with the help of http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents

Supported plattforms: windows/linux

Has a small toy syntax extension for visual studio code included.

The standard library barely deserves its name.

Not yet cleaned up. Developed sloppily over a few days without any tests.
